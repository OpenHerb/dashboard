# ngx-mqtt [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ngx-mqtt.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-mqtt) [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/sclausen/ngx-mqtt.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sclausen/ngx-mqtt)

This library isn't just a wrapper around MQTT.js for angular.
It uses observables and takes care of subscription handling and message routing.

This means although you have the possibility of mqtt.js to use `mqtt`, `mqtts`, `tcp`, `ssl`, `wx` or `wxs` as the protocol in the client options, you can't, because this is a browser library where you can't conntect with something other than websockets. You also can't use `key`, `cert` and `ca` for the same reasons.

If you have any issues using this library, please visit it's [homepage](https://sclausen.github.io/ngx-mqtt/) and look for similar issues in the issue tracker before you file a bug.

## **ngx-mqtt >= 7 is only compatible with angular >= 9**
